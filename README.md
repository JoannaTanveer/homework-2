# homework-2

This is the beginning of my personal portfolio. I have really only made 3 things I am proud of: My scratch game, my first website, and my daughter.

I used bootstrap styling with the cards in the portfolio, the navigation bar, as well as the with form on the contact page. I used columns and rows otherwise.
